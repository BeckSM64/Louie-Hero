# Louie-Hero
A ROM hack for Bomberman Hero which exclusively features Louie

# Requirements
In order to play the ROM you'll need a clean copy of Bomberman Hero (JP only right now), and CajeASM. You can get CajeASM [here](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/1085/). I can't link to where you can get a JP ROM for Bomberman Hero, but I believe in your abilities to find one.

# How to generate it
Once you have CajeASM installed, launch the GUI and specify the path of your clean Bomberman Hero ROM and the ASM included in this repository. Click assemble and you're all set.

# Known Issues
There are a few levels that are currently not beatable with Louie:
- Bubble Hole
- Magma Dam (Exit 1, can take Exit 2)
- Hard Coaster
- Mad Coaster

I baked in debug mode for now so people can mess around with it and just skip the unbeatable levels, but currently working on fixing those issues

# Questions
If you have questions or need help generating the ROM, you can contact me directly
